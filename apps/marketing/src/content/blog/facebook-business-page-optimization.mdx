Your Facebook Business Page is often the first touchpoint between your brand and potential customers. Yet most businesses set up their page once and never revisit it—missing opportunities to improve visibility, credibility, and conversions.

This optimization checklist covers everything from basic setup to advanced strategies that will make your page work harder for your business.

## Profile Fundamentals

These basics seem simple, but errors here cost you visibility and trust.

### Profile Picture

**Requirements**:
- 170 x 170 pixels on desktop, 128 x 128 on mobile
- Square format (Facebook will crop circular)
- High resolution, not pixelated

**Best practices**:
- Use your logo for brand recognition
- Ensure it's recognizable at small sizes
- Avoid text (illegible when cropped)
- Maintain consistency with other platforms

### Cover Photo

**Requirements**:
- 820 x 312 pixels on desktop, 640 x 360 on mobile
- 16:9 aspect ratio works best across devices

**Optimization tips**:
- Showcase your value proposition or current promotion
- Include a subtle call-to-action
- Update seasonally or for campaigns
- Keep critical elements centered (edges crop on mobile)
- Consider using video covers for higher engagement

### Page Name

Your page name directly impacts searchability:

- Use your actual business name
- Add location if relevant ("Joe's Coffee - Portland")
- Include primary keyword if natural ("Portland Web Design | Studio X")
- Avoid keyword stuffing or ALL CAPS

**Warning**: Changing your name too frequently can impact page trust. Get it right from the start.

### Username (@handle)

**Requirements**:
- 5-50 characters
- Letters, numbers, and periods only
- Must be unique across Facebook

**Best practices**:
- Match your handle across all platforms
- Keep it short and memorable
- Avoid numbers unless part of your brand name
- Make it easy to type and spell

## About Section Optimization

This section is both human-readable and indexed by search engines. Optimize for both.

### Short Description (255 characters)

This appears in search results and page previews. Make it count:

- Lead with your primary value proposition
- Include your main keyword naturally
- Make it action-oriented
- Avoid generic phrases like "We're a company that..."

**Example**:
> "Award-winning Portland coffee roastery. Ethically sourced single-origin beans roasted fresh daily. Visit our cafe or order online for home delivery."

### Long Description

Expand on your short description with:

- Your story and mission
- Services or products offered
- What makes you different
- Geographic areas served
- Years in business or notable achievements

**SEO tip**: Naturally incorporate keywords your customers search for, but prioritize readability.

### Contact Information

Complete every field available:

- **Website**: Your primary URL (track with UTM parameters)
- **Phone**: Local number preferred for local businesses
- **Email**: Use a professional email, not personal
- **Address**: Critical for local SEO (if applicable)
- **Hours**: Keep updated, especially holidays

### Category Selection

Choose categories that accurately describe your business:

- Primary category affects search visibility significantly
- Select up to 3 categories
- Be specific (choose "Coffee Shop" over "Restaurant")
- Review competitors' categories for ideas

## Call-to-Action Button

The CTA button is prime real estate. Choose wisely based on your goals:

| Button Option | Best For |
|--------------|----------|
| Book Now | Service businesses, appointments |
| Contact Us | Lead generation, B2B |
| Shop Now | E-commerce |
| Sign Up | Newsletters, memberships |
| Learn More | Complex products, information |
| Call Now | Local businesses, urgent services |

**Optimization tips**:
- Link to a page optimized for that specific action
- Test different CTAs and track click-through rates
- Ensure landing page delivers on the promise

## Services and Products

Facebook lets you showcase offerings directly on your page.

### Adding Services

- List all services with clear descriptions
- Include pricing (ranges acceptable)
- Add high-quality images
- Use keywords in service names and descriptions

### Product Catalog

For businesses with products:

- Connect your product catalog via Commerce Manager
- Organize into collections
- Include prices and availability
- Tag products in posts for seamless shopping

## Facebook Page SEO

Your page can rank in both Facebook and Google searches. Optimize for both.

### Keyword Strategy

**Research keywords** your customers use:
- Brand terms (your business name)
- Category terms ("Portland coffee shop")
- Service terms ("espresso drinks downtown")
- Problem/solution terms ("best coffee near me")

**Incorporate keywords** in:
- Page name (if natural)
- Short description
- Long description
- Post content
- Photo alt text
- Service and product descriptions

### Backlinks to Your Page

Pages with more external links rank better:
- Link to your Facebook page from your website
- Include in email signatures
- Add to business directories
- Request links from partners and suppliers

### Reviews and Ratings

Positive reviews boost both trust and SEO:
- Enable reviews on your page
- Respond to all reviews (positive and negative)
- Ask satisfied customers to leave reviews
- Address negative reviews professionally

## Content Optimization

Great content keeps visitors engaged and turns them into customers.

### Pinned Post

Your pinned post appears first for all visitors. Use it for:
- Current promotion or offer
- Brand introduction video
- High-performing evergreen content
- Important announcement

Update your pinned post monthly or when priorities change.

### Content Mix

Balance different content types:

| Content Type | Frequency | Purpose |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Educational | 30% | Build trust, provide value |
| Entertaining | 20% | Increase engagement, shares |
| Promotional | 20% | Drive sales, conversions |
| Community | 15% | Build connection, loyalty |
| User-Generated | 15% | Social proof, engagement |

### Post Formatting

**For maximum reach**:
- Native video outperforms external links
- Photos outperform text-only posts
- Albums allow multiple images without collage
- Live video gets prioritized in feeds

**Caption best practices**:
- Front-load key information (truncated in feeds)
- Use line breaks for readability
- Include clear CTAs
- Hashtags: 1-3 relevant hashtags (unlike Instagram, more isn't better)

## Engagement Features

Utilize Facebook's built-in engagement tools.

### Messenger Integration

- Enable Messenger for your page
- Set up instant replies for after-hours
- Create FAQs with automated responses
- Use greeting messages to set expectations

**Response time tip**: Facebook displays your response time publicly. Aim for under 1 hour to earn the "Very responsive" badge.

### Events

If you host events:
- Create Facebook events for each
- Enable ticket purchasing if applicable
- Post updates in the event discussion
- Go live during events for expanded reach

### Groups

Consider creating a linked group for community:
- More organic reach than pages
- Deeper engagement with customers
- Valuable feedback channel
- Builds brand loyalty

## Analytics and Insights

Facebook Insights provides valuable performance data.

### Key Metrics to Monitor

**Weekly**:
- Reach and engagement rate
- Click-through rate on CTA button
- Top-performing posts
- Audience growth

**Monthly**:
- Follower demographics
- Best posting times
- Content type performance
- Comparison to previous periods

### Insights-Driven Optimization

Use data to improve performance:

1. **Identify top content**: Double down on what works
2. **Find optimal timing**: Post when your audience is active
3. **Understand demographics**: Tailor content to your actual audience
4. **Track CTA performance**: Adjust based on click data

## Common Optimization Mistakes

### Incomplete Information

Every empty field is a missed opportunity. Complete your profile 100%—even fields that seem optional.

### Inconsistent Branding

Your Facebook page should visually match your website and other platforms. Use the same logo, colors, and messaging.

### Neglecting Mobile

Over 90% of Facebook users access via mobile. Preview your page on mobile and ensure:
- Cover photo looks good cropped
- Contact buttons are easily tappable
- Key information visible without scrolling

### Ignoring Reviews

Unanswered reviews (especially negative ones) signal poor customer service. Respond to every review.

### Set-and-Forget Approach

Your page needs regular updates:
- Fresh cover photos
- Updated pinned posts
- Current business hours
- Relevant content
