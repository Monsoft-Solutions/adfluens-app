Google Business Profile (formerly Google My Business) posts appear directly in search results when people look for your business—prime real estate that most local businesses underutilize. While competitors leave their profiles stale, you can use posts to showcase what makes your business worth visiting.

This guide covers the post types that drive the most action, with templates and examples you can adapt for your business.

## Why GBP Posts Matter for Local Businesses

When someone searches for your business or your category, your Google Business Profile often appears before your website. Posts show up in this profile, giving you additional space to:

- Highlight current offers and events
- Showcase your products and services
- Share updates and news
- Stand out from competitors with stale profiles

**The visibility advantage**: Posts can appear in Google Search, Google Maps, and the Google Maps app—reaching customers at the exact moment they're looking for businesses like yours.

**The freshness signal**: Regularly posting signals to Google that your business is active and engaged, which can positively influence local search rankings.

## Optimizing Posts for Maximum Impact

Templates are starting points. These optimization tips increase engagement.

### Visual Best Practices

**Photo requirements**:
- Minimum 720 x 720 pixels (1200 x 900 recommended)
- JPEG or PNG format
- Under 5MB file size
- Well-lit, high quality

**What works**:
- Photos of real products (not stock)
- Your team at work
- Your space/location
- Customers (with permission)
- Results of your service

**What doesn't work**:
- Blurry or dark images
- Stock photos (look generic)
- Too much text in images
- Images without clear subject

### Writing for the 100-Character Limit

The first 100 characters are what users see before clicking "More." Front-load your value:

**Weak opening**:
> "We're excited to announce that starting this month..."

**Strong opening**:
> "25% off all services this week only. New customers..."

**Formula**: Lead with the benefit or offer, then add details.

### CTA Button Selection

Choose the button that matches your goal:

| Button | Use When |
|--------|----------|
| Book | Service businesses with appointments |
| Order online | Restaurants, retail with online ordering |
| Buy | Direct product sales |
| Learn more | Complex offerings, more info needed |
| Sign up | Events, newsletters, memberships |
| Get offer | Promotions with specific redemption |
| Call now | Urgent services, consultations |

### Posting Frequency

**Minimum**: 1 post per week to maintain profile freshness

**Optimal**: 2-3 posts per week for maximum visibility

**Post lifespan**: Update posts stay visible for about 7 days; Offer and Event posts stay until their end date

**Scheduling tip**: Plan posts around your business rhythm—new arrivals, weekly specials, upcoming events.

## Measuring Post Performance

GBP Insights shows how posts perform.

### Key Metrics

**Views**: How many people saw your post

**Clicks**: Clicks on photos, CTA buttons, or "Learn more"

**Actions**: Button clicks specifically (calls, directions, website visits)

### What Good Performance Looks Like

Benchmarks vary by industry and location, but general guidelines:

- **View-to-click rate**: 2-5% is average, 5%+ is good
- **Click-to-action rate**: Depends on your CTA goal

### Improving Performance

**Low views?**
- Post more frequently
- Improve photo quality
- Ensure business info is complete

**Views but no clicks?**
- Improve headline/hook
- Make offer more compelling
- Test different CTAs

## Common Posting Mistakes

### Being Too Salesy

Every post doesn't need to sell. Mix promotional content with genuinely helpful updates.

### Inconsistent Posting

Posting 5 times one week then nothing for a month sends mixed signals. Consistency matters more than volume.

### Poor Image Quality

Blurry, dark, or generic stock photos hurt credibility. Invest in decent photos of your actual business.

### Ignoring Analytics

If you're not checking what works, you're guessing. Review performance monthly and adjust.

### Missing CTA Buttons

Every post should have an action. Make it easy for interested people to take the next step.

### Wall of Text

Long paragraphs get skipped. Use short sentences, line breaks, and bullet points for scannability.

## Conclusion

Google Business Profile posts are one of the most underutilized tools in local marketing. While your competitors let their profiles go stale, consistent, compelling posts can help you stand out in local search results and turn searchers into customers.

Start with one post this week. Use the templates above, add a quality photo, and include a clear CTA. Track the results, then iterate.

The businesses winning local search are those who treat their GBP as an active marketing channel—not a set-and-forget directory listing.
