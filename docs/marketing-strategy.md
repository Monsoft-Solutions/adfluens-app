## 5. Unique Differentiators

### The Five Pillars of Differentiation

#### 1. AI-First Architecture

**Proof Points**:

- Content generation that matches your voice on first try

**Proof Points**:

- Manage 100+ locations from one dashboard

- Response templates that still feel personal

**Proof Points**:

- See your entire reputation in one dashboard

- No feature-gating to upsell

**Proof Points**:
